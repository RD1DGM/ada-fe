## Challenges
To start of this assignment, I used React for the client-side and Redux for state management (handling data).

**How would you handle large datasets on the client?**

I would use Redux to handle large datasets while at the same time, making sure that components are optimized

**What could be potential user experience challenges in the future?**

Potential UX challenges in the future could be accessibility issues

**How would you make this accessible?**

I could make this accessible by using proper semantic markups, using proper styling of texts (colors, contrasts, etc.), using descriptive names of links, and proper alt text for images to name a few.

**What would you change if you had more time to work on it?**

If given more time to work on this, I would tackle the issues I stated above.
